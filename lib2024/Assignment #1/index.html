                <h2>Storyline</h2>
                <p>Set 30 years after its predecessor, it follows Maverick's return to the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (also known as U.S. Navy-Fighter Weapons School - "TOPGUN"), where he must confront his past as he trains a group of younger pilots, among them the son of Maverick's deceased best friend Lieutenant Nick "Goose" Bradshaw, USN.</p>

                <h2>Did you know?</h2>
                <p>At the insistence of Tom Cruise, minimal green screen and CGI aerial shots exist in the film, and even the close up cockpit shots were taken during real in-flight sequences. This meant that much of the cast had to undergo extensive G-force training sessions to withstand the physical demands of G-force pressures during flights.</p>

            Note to myself:<br />
            There are so many references to the original that I was brought to childhood when I had first seen it.

            The best cinematic experience of my life and a perfect gift to all Top Gun fans.
